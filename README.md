# School Gr11 - Movie Theatre Project (C)

A program which allows the user to choose between a variety of options when printing a ticket to a movie theatre.

## How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). This program does not use any files so all that is really needed is the .c file.

## How to Use

The controls should be very intuitive as per the requirements of the assignment.  
The program includes the following choices which the user must make:  
* The movie they wish to view with ratings, age ratings, and a description provided  
* The number of seats they wish to reserve (with randomized availability)  
* The age range and student status of each person, corresponding to the final price  
* Entering a code to recieve free popcorn (code is ICS3U)  
  
The program focuses on aesthetics and navigability as well as extensive documentation within the code.
